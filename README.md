# plot.ly-challenge

The visualizations showing the bacteria colonizing human navels based on [this dataset.](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)
Please see full page deployed on [GitHub Pages here.](https://nadiarichards.github.io/plot.ly-challenge/)

Visualizations were made using JavaScript (Plot.ly library) by utilizing data from .json file.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Please see the link to my code [here.](https://github.com/nadiarichards/plot.ly-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js) 

## Methods and languages used:

1. JavaScript
2. Plot.ly library
3. HTML for writing the code for the webpage

Please see the screenshots below.
